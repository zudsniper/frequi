[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?logo=visualstudiocode&label=&message=Open%20in%20Visual%20Studio%20Code&labelColor=2c2c32&color=007acc&logoColor=007acc)](https://open.vscode.dev/freqtrade/frequi)
![FreqUI CI](https://github.com/freqtrade/frequi/workflows/FreqUI%20CI/badge.svg)

Freqtrade UI build with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [boostrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/).

## WARNING

This project is still in its early stages (consider it alpha), and is not yet stable nor recommended to be used for production usages.

## Run this project

Using FreqUI, does require [freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) to be setup and running.
In newer versions (2021.2 and newer), freqUI is builtin to freqtrade, so manual setup of freqUI will no longer be necessary unless you want to modify freqUI.
Instructions for this end-user setup can be found in the [freqtrade API documentation](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/rest-api/).

### Running a standalone version of FreqUI

Using Docker, you can also run a pre-built docker image of FreqUI.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start a pre-built container with FreqUI running on port 3000 - which defaults to the latest version of freqUI.
You can use `docker compose pull` to update to the latest version of the UI.

Please note: This is a standalone version of FreqUI, and will still require a correctly configured freqtrade bot.
You'll need to correctly configure [CORS](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/rest-api/#cors) in freqtrade to allow FreqUI to connect to the API.

## Developer project setup

It will require [freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) to be running on the same host with the API enabled under (`localhost:8080`). You can either use the webpack proxy (port can be changed in `vite.config.js`) - or connect directly to the API (recommended).

You will also have to have CORS for freqtrade configured correctly based on the [freqtrade documentation](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/rest-api/#cors).
Most likely, the correct entry will be `http://localhost:3000` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000` - but the URL must match the URL you use to access FreqUI.
Ports can vary, so check the URL you're using.

## Project setup for docker (developing inside dev container) without vscode

### Built dev docker image and run container(s) detached

```
cd .devcontainer
docker-compose up -d
```

### Go inside web-service container and serve

## Project setup for vscode and docker (developing inside dev container) on Linux

The goal is to have a complete dev environment very quickly and isolated.
